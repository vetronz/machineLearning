These guidelines are written in R and plain text but you can use whatever language you prefer.

These exercises are not assessed.

These potential solutions refer only to praticals described in the Bayesian statistics notebook.
If you have queries on specific minor tasks throughout all notebooks, please let me know.

For pratical 3, no fixed solution is given but rather a collection of previous (and satisfactory) answers given by former students.
