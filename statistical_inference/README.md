# Statistical Inference

Introduction to probability and statistics for MSc Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology and MSc Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution at Imperial College London.

This repository includes all material taught by Matteo Fumagalli and should be used only by students in the aforementioned courses.

## Instructions

You can use your laptop during lectures, but you don't have to.

To clone the repository on your machine:
```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mfumagal/statistical_inference
```

To fill in cells and take notes using the provided jupyter notebooks, you need to install:
```
conda update conda
conda update --all # to make sure you have the latest version
conda install jupyter
```
and the R kernel:
```
conda install r r-essentials
```
Then open it
```
jupyter-notebook
```
The first time you open a notebook, make sure you have a "clean" version by clicking on "restart and clear output" under the "Kernel" option.

Likewise, a good source for latex formatting of mathematical objects is [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

Examples are in R. Some tutorials on how to program in R can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/mfumagal/biological_computing_in_r_main/src/master/).

These notes and slides have been mostly based on "Statistical Inference", Casella & Berger, 2nd Ed.; "Bayesian methods for Data Analysis", Carlin & Louis, 3rd Ed.; taught material from Professor M Stumpf.
